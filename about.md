Hi, my name is Adi. I am a full-stack Ruby on Rails programmer ðŸ’Ž

Apart from being a programmer, I also love writing about everything, whether it's food (i like foodies!), or my thoughts about something.

I'd love to write technical stuff sometimes, either it's a #TIL or share something that I already know.
