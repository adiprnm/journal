## Doing a full time job

I work at one of the SaaS company in Indonesia remotely.


## Working on personal projects

In the mean time, I craft some web-based apps. Two of them already released: [Kanyaah](https://kanyaah.com) and [Gawéeun](https://gaweeun.my.id). Gawéeun currently have no active development, since I designed it as [the finished software](/posts/the-finished-softwares). Some of them are still in development.

## Reading and writing blogs

I've read a lot blogs recently. Most of them are published at [the bear blog](https://bearblog.dev). Reading the blog posts urges me to write more blog posts again, just the good old times.

## Start journaling

This one is a personal one. Much like a diary, lol. I write it in a simple txt files. No fancy tools.

I once did this in circa 2014, but still inconsistent. Now after 10 years, I'm doing this again.

Will I be more consistent? I don't know, let's just try it.
